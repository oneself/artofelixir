I've recently joined a company which uses [Elixir][elixir] as their main backend
programming language. Elixir is a functional language which uses the [Erlang
BEAM virtual machine][beam] to run and is influenced by Ruby, Erlang, and
Clojure. I've always been a fan of functional programming -- though more as a
hobby. I initially discovered it by exploring Python's few functional
features. I've also been using emacs as my main text and code editor for years
now, which necessitates knowing some lisp. I've also been using [xmonad][xmonad]
as my main desktop, which force you to dabble in [Haskell][haskell].

I've also wanted to read [Donland Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming][art]
for some time now.  So, I decided to combine these two, and to sprinkle some
extra motivation on top by reading through the book and then implementing each
algorithm described using Elixir.

This blog is really a type of [commitment device][commitment] that I am using on
myself.  Hoping it will motivate me to read and learn.  If it also provides any
benefit to anyone else, all the better.

It is important to note that I am an Elixir newbie.  As I learn more about
Elixir, I will try to go back and fix some of my earlier mistakes, and improve
code quality, but I make no claims that the Elixir code contained within this
block should be used as a way to learn Elixir.

I am learning Haskell by reading [Elixir in Action][action], which I have
purchased a copy of.  I am using [The Art of Computer Programming's third
edition][art].

All the code I will post here is my own, and is licensed under the [GPL][gpl].  This means that it
can be reused and modified by others in whatever way they see fit.
