When I started reading The Art of Computer Programming, I was really surprised
to find how funny it is.  Knuth seems to have a real talent for sprucing up,
what is usually considered, pretty dry subject matter.

Case in point: the preface contains a procedure and flowchart for how to read
this and other books in The Art series `(◠‿◠)`.
