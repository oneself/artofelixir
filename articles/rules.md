1. I must implement every algorithm described in the book as I read it.  This is
   denoted by a bold **Algorithm [A]**.
2. I need to use Elixir to code the solution.
3. I should try and code algorithms from scratch, and try to avoid using Elixir
   standard library functions in cases where that would obviate the need to
   implement at all, but using them where it makes sense.
4. This does not include the exercises outlined at the end of many
   sections. Though I might select some, where it makes sense.
5. If I cannot implement an algorithm, I must make a good faith effort to
   implement something close to it.
6. When I discover a better way of doing something in Elixir, I should to go
   back and update already completed algorithms.
